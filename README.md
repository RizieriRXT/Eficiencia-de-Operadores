# 📞 Data-Driven Insights: Ineffective Operator Detection in Telecom Services

This project analyzes operator performance within the virtual telephony service **CallMeMaybe**, using real operational data. The goal is to identify ineffective operators based on missed calls, long wait times, and low outbound activity.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To test the hypothesis:

> Operator inefficacy is associated with high missed call rates, long wait times, and low outbound call volume.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analysis
- **CSV Datasets**: `telecom_dataset_us.csv`, `telecom_clients_us.csv`

---

## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Description
- Explored the structure and quality of both datasets.
- Assessed call metadata and client profiles.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and formatting issues.
- Removed duplicates and standardized column types.

### 3. Exploratory Analysis
- Visualized call patterns, operator behavior, and client segmentation.
- Identified outliers and performance trends.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Applied statistical tests to validate whether missed calls and wait times significantly correlate with operator inefficacy.

### 5. Operator Classification
- Defined thresholds and logic to flag ineffective operators based on combined metrics.

---

## ✅ Results

- Operators with high missed call rates and long wait durations are consistently underperforming.
- Low outbound call activity among assigned operators is a reliable inefficacy signal.
- These indicators can be used to build supervisor dashboards and trigger performance alerts.
